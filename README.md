## INTERNATIONAL DEBT STATISTICS FROM THE WORLD BANK

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank from 1970 to 2015 using SQL. 

This dataset contains both national and regional debt (in USD) statistics for different countries across the globe.

In this project, I found answers to questions like:

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

### Technically 

I connected the database from the Jupyter Notebook's environment for the analysis. 

I wrote different SQL queries using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses. 

I also performed simple subqueries as a filter on WHERE clauses. 

I used aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT or summarized functions like MAX and MIN to get aggregate or summarized numerical data.

Finally, I aliased columns for analysis' better understanding.
